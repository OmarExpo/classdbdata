# classdbdata
Fetch data from MySQL using Spring Boot with Thymeleaf.

In this project, I tried to display my DB data from MySQL into an HTML page.

Application, tools and Technologies used are:
_ Spring Framework
_ Intellij Idea (Ultimate Ed.)
_ Thymeleaf Engine
Dependencies:
_ Web
_ JDBC
_ Thymeleaf
_ Dev Tools

In conclusion, when implementing this project, I was adhering to MVC (Model - View - Controller) pattern as it was the requirements.
Hence, it makes sense to use Maven as the dependency Management tool for providing ready-made project structure.
